NOTES

1. i didnt include nodemon as a dependency because its not necessary for production
2. to use nodemon, you can just run 'npm run dev'
3. no authentication here. i might update later. this is bare-bones
4. the purpose for this is simple copypasta. you can copy routes and just update:
  a) the parameter used for identifying duplicate POSTs
  b) update the object attributes that you .pick to reflect your new model
  c) you can just keep adding routes exactly like the ones currently supplied for user.

:)


UPDATE:
Tested POST and GET for user. each working.
